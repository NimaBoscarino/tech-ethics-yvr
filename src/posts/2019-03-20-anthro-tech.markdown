    As AI advances, many products are being built with human features as a core part of their design. In this session, we dove into what that means, and explored the decisions and conversations that arise as a result of this.

What human qualities are robot care-takers designed to exhibit?
What are the social implications of products like sex robots?
What does it mean to be human?

### Questions

- Would we reveal more to anthropomorphic tech than traditional tech? E.g. interrogation, phishing
- What about human-computer friendships?
- Ethical questions of not revealing to the user that they are talking to an AI
- Why are so many personal assistants gendered to be female by default?
- What human qualities are robot care-takers designed to exhibit?
- What are the social implications of products like sex robots?
- What does it mean to be human-like?


### Rough notes from during the discussion

```
Robots and therapy - no emotional baggage

Transparency of bots - people are more at ease talking to bots

Bias of programs/bots (e.g. in therapy)

Autonomous warfare

"The world is built for humans, so robots that are humanlike can coexist more easily" - Sanctuary AI

Androgynous voices
- Does this propagate violence vs. trans folks

Who can enforce this stuff?
- Government?
- In a capitalist society...
- Education
- So, should there be an ethical certification? A-la LEED

Education + critical thinking: Question your assumptions
