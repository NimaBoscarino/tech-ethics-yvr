Tradition, Transmission, Transparency: Building Non-Commercial Tech with Indigenous Communities Across Canada and Papua New Guinea


This talk will focus on the collaborative process of working with communities and relationship building. David Lacho will problematize common-held notions of tradition, transmission, and “preservation” while talking to the idea of being transparent and accountable in the dev process. David’s learning from communities across the world can be transferred to meaningful and ethical decision making in user experience research as well as application design.


#### About our guest, David Lacho

With training as a linguistic anthropologist immersed in research, David Lacho is a polyglot developer (and Lighthouse Labs alum) that has worked to reclaim Indigenous placenames of the land, investigate the unique francophone Madelinot culture, translate a sapient humanoid language from French into English, and plunge into modern technology.

David Lacho is the lead developer on an augmented reality app that is helping revitalize the traditional Secwepemctsín dialect of Splatsin, a language spoken by just 10 to 15 people in the community, most of whom are speakers in their 90s. He also works in remote villages in Papua New Guinea on technology projects, where villagers have smartphones and tablets, however there is no internet, cell phone service, or power.

Jokingly self-described as a kind of “language IT guy,” Lacho was the recipient of UBC Okanagan’s 2018 Master Student Researcher of the Year. Among other awards, he was one of only 10 Canadian Master’s scholars in 2016 to receive the Canada Graduate Scholarships to Honour Nelson Mandela, awarded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.
