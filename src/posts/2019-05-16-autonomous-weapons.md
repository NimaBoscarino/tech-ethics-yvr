What kinds of decisions should go into designing and developing autonomous weapons?
	
	- power
		- power to power these things -> electricity
		- make it last a long time, and how heavy it is
	- transparency
		- review -> video footage
		- it becomes easier to record
	- in a way, it _can_ become clearer _who_ made the decision.
	- it should never be fully autonomous
	- who's responsible for failure?
	- security
	- try to make it as surgical as you can -> avoid mass approaches
