### Rough Notes from Discussion

### Rough planning notes

I thought it would be neat to document the notes that I put together for planning this session!

- Intro to the session - CHECK
- Intro to the topic
  - FIPPA
  - PIPA
  - GDPR
- Intro to Carlo
- Carlo time!
  - Q and A

- meaningful consent

Both of these are for BC

- FIPPA
  - rundown
  - 90's never fully updated, small amendments
- PIPA
  - rundown
  - why aren't there any explicit recommendations or guidelines for technical security stuff? E.g. how to encrypt, where to store, medium to store data in.

- Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Online Request (Federal)

Newfoundland - also has FOI stuff

- GDPR rundown
  
- Submitting your own FIPPA requests
  
- What to keep in mind as developers

Convenience vs. privacy
- weather privacy (New york times) https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html)
- woman finds that her husband was cheating on her

Facebook and Protesting

- Carlo has info from inside (Georgia Straight Alliance)
- omnipotent power
  - by race, etc. target curches for votes
  - protests

Loopholes / exemptions to FIPA
- no duty to document
  - the government isn't mandated to write anything down
    - use phone calls!
    - email chain that says "lets move to phone call"
    - can we please move to phone call
- the more tech we have, the more access we have (more likely to email)
- they try to tire you out


PIPA GUIDE: 

https://www.oipc.bc.ca/guidance-documents/1438

What is a right?
- legal
- ethical

We generally look at it as a legal thing instead of an ethical thing. It's interesting what we perceive what a right is????

Designating a privacy officer? PIPA and FIPPA (government always has someone)

_Some random quotes from the PIPA guide:_

The PIPA regulations require that, for an individual who is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated, an organization must obtain consent from a legal representative, such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney.

You may only collect personal information for a purpose that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. You must limit your collection to the amount and type of personal information that is necessary to fulfill your purposes for collecting it. You must notify individuals of the reasonable purposes for collecting personal information before or at the time you collect that information. You must obtain consent from an individual before or at the time you collect personal information.

```
Be careful of Reasonable Use!
=============================

Anja owns a bookstore and maintains an email list of customers who want information on new releases. When her friend, Rose, decides to run for city council, sheuses this list to send out a mass email urging her
customers to vote for Rose as a pro-book candidate. Rose has contravened PIPA because she is using the collected information for a new purpose (to campaign for Rose) without first determining whether the new use is reasonable and before notifying her customers that she wishes to use their email addresses for this new purpose and obtaining their consent to do so.
